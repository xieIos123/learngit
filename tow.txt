Guideline 4.3 - Design


This app duplicates the content and functionality of other apps submitted by you or another developer to the App Store, which is considered a form of spam.

Apps that simply duplicate content or functionality create clutter, diminish the overall experience for the end user, and reduce the ability of developers to market their apps.

The next submission of this app may require a longer review time, and this app will not be eligible for an expedited review until this issue is resolved.
